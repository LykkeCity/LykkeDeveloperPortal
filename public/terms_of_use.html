          <div class="level2">
            <p>Lykke is a provider of an electronic wallet service (Lykke Wallet). This Wallet can be accessed by the use of the Lykke app. Like a physical wallet, the purpose of this electronic Wallet is simply storage. The objects being stored in the Lykke Wallet are Lykke Coins representing digitally Lykke Shares. A Lykke coin is a colored coin that is issued by Lykke Corp. One Lykke colored coin is 0.01 (one one-hundredth) of one share of Lykke Corp. 100 Lykke colored coins are one share of Lykke Corp..</p>
            <p>Within the Lykke app the user can buy or sell Lykke Coins by using a national currency or the digital currency bitcoin as payment option for buying and selling Lykke Coins.</p>
            <p>Lykke Wallet is no platform for bitcoin trading and therefore does not set any stock prices on bitcoins. Bitcoin is solely a payment option for buying or selling Lykke Coins.</p>
            <p>Our Services may evolve over time. This means we may apply changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reasonable cause with two days&rsquo; notice or without notice in case of a Force Majeure. In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services. If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with a notice via our website.</p>
            <p>A Force Majeure Event includes without limitation each of the following:</p>
            <p>a) Government actions, the outbreak of war or hostilities, the threat of war, acts of terrorism, national emergency, riot, civil disturbance, sabotage, requisition, or any other international calamity, economic or political crisis;</p>
            <p>b) Act of God, earthquake, tsunami, hurricane, typhoon, accident, storm, flood, fire, epidemic or other natural disaster;</p>
            <p>c) Labour disputes and lock-out;</p>
            <p>f) Breakdown, failure or malfunction of any electronic, network and communication lines (not due to the bad faith or wilful default of Lykke);</p>
            <p>g) Any event, act or circumstances not reasonably within Lykke&rsquo;s control and the effect of that event(s) is such that Lykke is not in a position to take any reasonable action to cure the default.</p>
            <p>Subject to the terms of these Terms of Use and the Rules, Lykke shall use reasonable efforts to make available, operate and maintain Lykke Services during the validity of these Terms and to permit you to access and use Lykke Services in accordance with these Terms and the Rules. Lykke shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of any difficulties experienced by us or other members with respect to their access to or use of Lykke Services, but only to the extent that Lykke is aware of such difficulties and reasonably determines that they are material to the User&rsquo;s access to the use of Lykke Services. Similarly, the User shall notify Lykke in writing the soonest possible in case it becomes aware of any material technical failures of or difficulties with Lykke Services or upon becoming aware of any material breach (or any event which, by giving notice and/or the lapse of time, would constitute a material breach) of these Terms.</p>

            <p>Upon Lykke receiving an instruction from you to withdraw funds from your Account, Lykke shall pay the said amount within five Business Days, if the following requirements are met:</p>

          <div class="level2">
            <p>Lykke cannot and does not guarantee that the transactions in Lykke Coins will be profitable. You acknowledge and agree that the transactions in Lykke Coins may be highly volatile (i.e. high volatility may occur during important news events, economic surprises, unusual social events etc.) and that buying and selling, financial Lykke involve the risk of acquiring shares in a start-up company.. LYKKE WALLET</p>
            <p>To buy or sell Lykke Coins with Lykke Wallet, simply click on the price button at the so called &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; tab of our App. You will be taken through a process that specifies and confirms the buy or sell order. The trade matched is broadcasted on the blockchain via Open Asset protocol and can be traced via Lykke blockchain explorer or Coinprism (see <a class="urlextern" title="http://www.coinprism.com" href="http://www.coinprism.com/" rel="nofollow">www.coinprism.com</a> for further details). Lykke charges no fees for matching the trades.</p>
            <p>Colored coins consensus network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming the trades via the Services,. Except in cases prescribed by law Lykke cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse Lykke Coin transactions, other than confirming the network&rsquo;s completion of a transaction. The network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. You acknowledge, agree and accept that the Lykke Coin transaction may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the network. When you send the buy or sell order via the Services, you authorize us to match your order and submit the resulted trade transaction in Lykke Coins to the network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="wallet_address_and_private_key" class="sectionedit9">WALLET ADDRESS AND PRIVATE KEY</h2>
          <div class="level2">
            <p>When you create an account, the Services generate and store an encrypted digitalprivate and public key pair that you may use to send buy or sell orders in Lykke Coins. The public key generated by the Services works as your Lykke Coins&rsquo; Lykke Wallet address, and may be shared with the network and with others to complete Lykke Coins&rsquo; transactions. The private key uniquely matches the Lykke Wallet address and must be used in conjunction with the Lykke Wallet address to authorize the transfer of Lykke Coins from or to that Lykke Wallet address.</p>
            <p>The private key is stored on the secured area of your mobile phone encrypted by the password. The private key is also stored as SHA-265 encrypted string at Lykke cloud infrastructure, so that you may use multiple devices or recover Lykke Wallet on another device in case your device is lost or stolen. The private key is encrypted by your password. The password may be temporarily stored encrypted by PIN/TouchID during the opened session. When the session closes due to logging out, or inactivity timeout, or the application is reinstalled, or by demand of the user, or by the action of the Lykke compliance service, you have to login again using your password.
