            <div class="level2">
              <p>You understand and accept the risks in connection with trading securities, derivatives and financial instruments
                on Lykke and using the Services as set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not limited to, you
                understand the inherent risks listed hereinafter:
              </p>
              <p>a) Risk of software weaknesses: You understand and accept that the underlying software application and software
                platform (i.e., the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven,
                why there is no warranty that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent
                risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete
                loss of funds. </p>
              <p>b) Regulatory risk: You understand and accept that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction
                and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations
                addressing, blockchain technology-based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of Lykke
                and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Lykke Services, including its termination.
              </p>
              <p>c) Risk of loss of private key: Lykke can only be accessed by using the wallet with a combination of your account
                information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You understand
                and accept that if your private key file and password respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained products
                associated with your account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
              </p>
              <p>d) Risk of theft: You understand and accept that the underlying software application and software platform
                (i.e. the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that
                could result in theft or loss of funds.

              </p>
              <p>e)Risk of mining attacks: You understands and accepts that the blockchain used for the Lykke is susceptible
                to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining"
                attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Lykke Services.

                the transactions may be highly volatile (i.e., high volatility may occur during important news events, economic
                surprises, unusual social events, etc.) and that buying and selling products involves the risk of acquiring

              <p>When you create an account, the Services generate and store an encrypted digital private and public key pair

                to authorize the transfer of products from or to that Lykke Wallet address.
